                    Brianna Harrison’s journey starts off in Brazil in the year 1999. She was born in a small hospital (she’s not quite sure of the name but it is now a strip mall). As a kid she would travel all over the world due to her father’s career. She lived in Hong Kong for a few years, London next, then she ended up in Atlanta Georgia. All of this happened before she had even finished elementary school. After living in Atlanta Georgia for a few years, they moved to where she resides now, Omaha Nebraska. She attended middle school and high school in omaha, until her father got a new job which was based in California, but this time, she chose to move in with her grandparents in Washington. After graduating High School in Washington, she came back to Omaha to attend UNO, but switched to Metro as it is much cheaper. Currently she has one quarter left until gaining her associates degree, then she will continue her education at WGU online. Brianna has gone so many different places in her life, and she wants to continue that trend and visit many more. Right now Brianna’s focus is to get school done and over with, so she can get a high paying job that will allow her to travel. She mentioned that she potentially wants children, but that’s a discussion for later in her life.
