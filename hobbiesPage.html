She typically likes to read at least 3 books a week, and that's a slow week. She can read very quickly, and loves the fantasy genre. If it contains mythical creatures, she'll love it.</p>

Sharpie is perfect as it allows crisp lines, and has plenty of bright colors. Brianna doesn't have as much time to draw, but she loves to do it in her free time.</p>
